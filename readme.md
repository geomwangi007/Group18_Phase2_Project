# King County House Sales Price Prediction
## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices in King County, Washington, using regression modeling. The goal is to provide real estate agents with accurate pricing recommendations for homeowners looking to sell their properties as well as homebuyers looking to get a fair deal. By setting the right price, agents can attract more buyers and ensure a quicker sale.

### Stakeholder
Real Estate Agents: The primary stakeholders who will benefit from accurate pricing recommendations to help homeowners sell their houses quickly and at competitive prices.

### Objective
To develop a regression model that predicts the sale price of homes based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and other relevant variables.

## Approach
### Model Development: Use regression model to predict the sale price of homes.
Feature Analysis: Identify which features are the most influential in determining the price.
Prediction Accuracy: Evaluate model performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and RÂ².
## Dataset
The project uses the King County House Sales dataset, kc_house_data.csv, which contains the following features:

## Column Names and descriptions for Kings County Data Set
