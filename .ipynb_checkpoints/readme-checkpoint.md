#King County House Sales Price Prediction
##Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices in King County, Washington, using regression modeling. The goal is to provide real estate agents with accurate pricing recommendations for homeowners looking to sell their properties. By setting the right price, agents can attract more buyers and ensure a quicker sale.

###Stakeholder
Real Estate Agents: The primary stakeholders who will benefit from accurate pricing recommendations to help homeowners sell their houses quickly and at competitive prices.

###Objective
To develop a regression model that predicts the sale price of homes based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and other relevant variables.

##Approach
###Model Development: Use regression models to predict the sale price of homes.
Feature Analysis: Identify which features are the most influential in determining the price.
Prediction Accuracy: Evaluate model performance using metrics like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R².
##Dataset
The project uses the King County House Sales dataset, kc_house_data.csv, which contains the following features:

id: Unique identifier for a house
date: Date the house was sold
price: Sale price (target variable)
bedrooms: Number of bedrooms
bathrooms: Number of bathrooms
sqft_living: Square footage of the home
sqft_lot: Square footage of the lot
floors: Number of floors
waterfront: Whether the house has a waterfront view
view: Number of times the house has been viewed
condition: Condition of the house
grade: Overall grade given to the housing unit, based on King County grading system
sqft_above: Square footage of the house apart from the basement
sqft_basement: Square footage of the basement
yr_built: Year the house was built
yr_renovated: Year the house was renovated
zipcode: Zip code
lat: Latitude coordinate
long: Longitude coordinate
sqft_living15: Square footage of interior living space for the nearest 15 neighbors
sqft_lot15: Square footage of land lots of the nearest 15 neighbors
##Project Steps
###Data Collection and Preparation

Load and clean the dataset.
Handle missing values and outliers.
Convert dates and categorical variables to appropriate formats.
##Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualize the distribution of the target variable (price).
Analyze relationships between price and key features (e.g., sqft_living, bedrooms, bathrooms).
Feature Engineering

Create new features to improve model performance (e.g., age of the house, interaction terms).
Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.
Model Development

Start with a simple linear regression model.
Iterate with more complex models (e.g., polynomial regression, ridge regression, lasso regression).
Evaluate model performance using cross-validation.
Model Interpretation

Analyze the coefficients of the final model to understand the impact of each feature on the price.
Identify the most significant predictors.
Business Insights

Provide actionable recommendations to real estate agents on pricing strategies.
Highlight which home features add the most value to the property.
Evaluation Metrics
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Measures the average magnitude of the errors between predicted and actual prices.
R² (R-squared): Indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
Deliverables
GitHub Repository: Contains the code, data, and documentation.
Jupyter Notebook: Demonstrates the data analysis, model development, and results.
Non-technical Presentation: Summarizes the project, key findings, and actionable insights for stakeholders.
